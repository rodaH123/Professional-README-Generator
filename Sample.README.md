# Professional README Generator Starter Code

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

*Project Title*  Professional READ Me Application*

*Description: This challenge required usage of Inquirer to build a README Generator that included the regular content of a README file such as Title, Description, usage, Installation and tests.

- Through the use of Inquirer, question prompts were created that would later get added to the approrpate section of the READ ME file.
- Additionally, two other modules were used in generating the READ ME generator application. These modules were the Generate MD. JS and API. JS file which were used to pull in Github profile information.
-Creating this application makes it easier to generate information and creates a template for other files.
- It allows for efficiency
- This project provided a review and practice of node.js commands and syntax
